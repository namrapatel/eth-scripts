# eth-scripts

Old collection of scripts I've written to do various things with Ethereum contracts.

### function-selectors
- iirc the script in `getFunctionSelectors.ts` will retrieve function selectors 3 levels deep in the ABI you pass it
    - Currently hardcoded for what I used it for

### events
- iirc the script in `getEvents.ts` will parse a given contract from Etherscan and return all its events and their parameters
    - Currently hardcoded for what I used it for
